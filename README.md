I'm a 2nd year student pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Northwestern University (go cats!). I love working on projects and am currently building a MongoDB/Express/React/Node (MERN) stack web app for centralizing sales of upright basses and electric bass guitars of 10+ listing websites via Puppeteer. My current coursework is lower level and backend heavy, so I am pursuing passion projects to balance out my skills. Aside from programming, I enjoy playing upright bass in my university's Jazz Studies program, going to the gym, and attending tournaments for a fighting game I am ranked #18 in the world in.
